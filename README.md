# React D3 Blog Example

This is example code for my React D3 Test Double [blog post](https://samljones.com/2017-01-05/well-factored-pie-graph-react-d3/).

The code makes a Pie graph react component that renders with D3.

This example includes tests and a build to create a distributed JS file of the example.
